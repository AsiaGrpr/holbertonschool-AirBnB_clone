#Airbnb Clone Console
This is a console application that simulates some of the basic functionality of the Airbnb website. With this console, you can create, view, and book accommodations, as well as manage user accounts.

##Installation
To install this application, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone-console.git
Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and install the required dependencies:

javascript
Copy code
cd airbnb-clone-console
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
To start the console, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

Copy code
python airbnb.py

You will be presented with a command prompt, where you can enter commands to interact with the application. The available commands are:

* create account: Create a new user account
* login: Log in to an existing user account
* logout: Log out of the current user account
* create listing: Create a new accommodation listing
* view listings: View all available accommodation listings
* book: Book an accommodation listing
* view bookings: View all of the user's bookings

##Data Persistence
This console application uses a simple file-based database to store user accounts and accommodation listings. User accounts are stored in the users.json file, and accommodation listings are stored in the listings.json file. Bookings are stored in a separate bookings.json file.
